		Div tag is mostly used with CSS to style the given text. It allows to group content together. It can be a box around some content. Like a background for that particular content.The div tag for example could apply a yellow background to the text written here using CSS. A div tag is a block level element, i.e. if it is used between a given sentence then it will separate the content written inside it (push the content after it to the next line) with the content outside the div tag. For Example: Check this <div>A div tag is a block level element, i.e. if it is used between a given sentence then it will separate the content written inside it (push the content after it to the next line) with the content outside the div tag.</div>
